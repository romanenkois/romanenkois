### Projects

- [CtrlShop](https://ctrl-shop.vercel.app/home) - my favorite one so far. Its kinda simple, but it is fully functional shop marketplace, for quick distribution of fashionable clothes. App features the filterable product catalog, user authentication with Google OAuth, review system and an order processing. Front end is built with Angular 17, with maximum utilization of ng-signals. Backend app is built using Node.js on Express framework with document oriented MongoDB database for quick and flexible management of products

- [tunesTracker](https://tunes-tracker-client.vercel.app/) - is a lovely web app, that is retrieves data of user from his Spotify account and makes a kind of "yearly Spotify Wrapped", that user can access in any day of the year he wants, using tunesTracker. App quickly analyzes user data(tho the result can be inaccurate as tradeoff) and shows most listened songs, artists, albums and genres in periods of time, of last 4 weeks, 6 months, and of last year. App uses flexible «feature-sliced» code architecture, built in fast loading Angular 18. 

- [Cygma Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=romanenko.cygma-theme) - my custom made vs code theme extension. Made with care for my eyes, that like to code late at night. Made with intention of main focus on web development languages support, with more global support of wide variety of syntax support in mind. Bright and pastel colors on black background designed to help developer to focus on important things, while evading distractions. 

- [LogicLab](https://logic-lab-two.vercel.app/) - my own IT educational online-platform, designed to be perfect option for both beginners and already intermediate developers, who want to know more.
